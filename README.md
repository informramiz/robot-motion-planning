# robot-motion-planning
A python program to plan the motion of a robot. This is simple and basic problem. A robot has to go from start location to an end location in a maze with minimum cost possible. A robot can go left, right, up and down and performing each step costs 1. It can be seen in a picture below.

At the end the program prints the `final path` and `cost` or if it was not able to reach destination then it prints `fail`.
